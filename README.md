**🔍 About the App:**  
This app estimates the likelihood of a person being non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, or diabetic, guiding users to make informed health decisions.

**🛠️ Development Process:**  
- We began by creating a machine learning model using deep learning, analyzing 21 medical parameters for accurate diabetes risk prediction.
- The user interface, built with React.js, gathers input data from users.
- This data is processed in a Flask backend with an .h5 model file for predictions.
- The full app was deployed on Heroku for easy access.

**📚 Key Takeaways:**  
This project enhanced our understanding of the diabetes epidemic and allowed us to refine skills in web development, machine learning, and deployment. We explored and applied new technologies in a real-world context, gaining practical experience.
